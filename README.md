# Advent of Code 2021

## Goal
This repo contains my solutions for the 2021 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge. I've chosen to implement my solutions in Rust, and am using the problems as a learning experience to get better at programming with Rust. My goal is to learn how to make proper use of Rust's language features and write Rust code that is clean and (when possible) elegant.

## Usage
This project is built and run with Cargo. You can build the project with the following command:
```bash
cargo build
```
You can run the project for a specific day with the following command, where `D` is the number of the day to solve for:
```bash
cargo run D
```
